# Cool-Contacts
This repo will house all files regarding the full stack Contact Manager App that will be written for Leinecker's Object-Oriented Software Course.

Project Notes:
    * This project will be a simple full stack contact manager.
    * On initial render, the user will have the option to login or register.
    * Once a valid account has been accessed, the user will have the option to
      Create, Read, Update, or Delete their contacts.
        - Thus, there must be a search function on the contacts.
    * The app must reside on a remote server.
    * The minimum information for each contact: Name, Email, Phone, Date Created.
    * You must use Swagger Hub to document/test the API.
    * The API must use JSON to communicate between the front-end and back-end.

Submission Notes:
    * Each team member must submit the PowerPoint slides onto Webcourses.
    * The PowerPoint must include a Gantt Chart, Use Case Diagram, and
      an Entity Relationship Diagram.
    * Do not .zip the PowerPoint file.
